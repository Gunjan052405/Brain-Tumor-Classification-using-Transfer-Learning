# Brain-Tumor-Classification-using-Transfer-Learning
◦ Applied Morphological Operations and Canny edge Detector to reduce noise and extract contours
◦ Pretrained ResNet-50 model was leveraged and then Fine-tuned to obtain an accuracy of 97.98%
◦ Developed a web application using Flask that takes input as images and predicts tumor class
